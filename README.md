# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The written analysis has the following:
•	Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to use libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.
•	Results:
o	The Naïve Random over sampling the balanced accuracy score is 65% which is considered ok. The high risk recall score and precision scores are 66% and 1% respectively while the low risk recall and precision sore is 63% and 100% respectively.

o	 SMOTE the balanced accuracy score is 65% as well which is considered ok. The high risk recall score and precision scores are 58% and 1% respectively while the low risk recall and precision sore is 66% and 100% respectively.

o	Undersampling the balanced accuracy score is 51% which is considered poor. The high risk recall score and precision scores are 54% and 1% respectively while the low risk recall and precision sore is 59% and 100% respectively.

o	Combination (Over and Under) Sampling the balanced accuracy score is 63% which is considered ok. The high-risk recall score and precision scores are 65% and 1% respectively while the low risk recall and precision sore is 62% and 100% respectively.

o	Balanced Random Forest Classifier ,the balanced accuracy score is 78% which is considered good. The high-risk recall score and precision scores are 78% and 3% respectively while the low risk recall and precision sore is 89% and 100% respectively.

o	Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier, the balanced accuracy score is 92% which is considered good. The high-risk recall score and precision scores are 91% and 7% respectively while the low risk recall and precision sore is 94% and 100% respectively.

•	Summary:
o	All low risk precision  scores where 100% while high risk precision scores where less than 10% most recall and balanced accuracy scores were with in 60% but for the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier it was with in the 90’s which is why that is the recommended model to use .
